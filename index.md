## Data Science Portfolio Projects

Odunayo Onifade is a data scientist with a background in Urban Planning and Geomatics who focuses on solving problems in the telematics industry.  

#### I will follow these steps to complete the data process:

1. Import – Get the data from an original source

2. Store – Store the data into a data store (database is most common)

3. Extract – Get the data from the data store

4. Organize – Organize the data into a usable subset

5. Tidy – Scrub / Clean the data

6. Transform – Change data into something your program / algorithm / statistical package will understand

7. Visualize – Descriptive statistics exploration

8. Model – Statistics + Machine Learning + Experiment Design

9. Coding – Machine Learning + Algorithms + Code

10. Understand – Explain insights achieved

11. Communicate – What was the approach, what worked, what didn’t work, what assumptions were made, what would you do different, why do insights matter

12. Next Steps – Where you go from here

13. Document – Code + Thought process + where everything came from (makes it so that you can replicate in the future with ease)
